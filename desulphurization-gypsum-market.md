<p><h1>Desulphurization Gypsum Market Size 2024 - 2031 Global Industrial Analysis, Key Geographical Regions, Market Share, Top Key Players, Product Types and Forecast Research Report</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Desulphurization gypsum, also known as flue gas desulphurization (FGD) gypsum, is a by-product of the process used to remove sulfur dioxide (SO2) from flue gases emitted by coal-fired power plants. This by-product is produced by scrubbing the flue gases with a limestone slurry to react with the SO2, resulting in the formation of calcium sulfite. Further oxidation of the calcium sulfite produces gypsum.</p><p>The desulphurization gypsum market is expected to witness steady growth in the forecasted period. The increasing awareness regarding the harmful effects of sulfur dioxide emissions and the need for environmental sustainability are driving the demand for desulphurization gypsum. Governments and regulatory bodies across the globe are implementing stringent regulations to control and reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, which further fuels the demand for desulphurization gypsum.</p><p>The construction industry is the major consumer of desulphurization gypsum, particularly as a replacement for natural gypsum in wallboard production. Desulphurization gypsum is advantageous due to its abundance, low cost, and similar properties to natural gypsum. The growth of the construction industry, especially in emerging economies, is expected to boost the demand for desulphurization gypsum in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, the agricultural sector is also emerging as a significant consumer of desulphurization gypsum. It is used as a soil amendment to improve soil fertility and reduce aluminum toxicity. The increasing demand for sustainable agricultural practices and the need to enhance crop productivity sustainably contribute to the market growth.</p><p>However, challenges such as disposal of large quantities of desulphurization gypsum and its limited use in certain regions may restrain the market growth. Efforts are being made to encourage the utilization of desulphurization gypsum in different applications, such as cement, plaster, and fertilizer, to overcome these challenges and expand the market potential.</p><p>Overall, with the increasing focus on reducing sulfur dioxide emissions and the growing applications of desulphurization gypsum in various industries, the market is expected to witness steady growth. The estimated CAGR of 2.30% during the forecasted period signifies the positive outlook and potential opportunities in the desulphurization gypsum market.</p></p>
