<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Corrosion Paints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Based Paints</li><li>Solvent-Based Paints</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Anti-corrosion paints are used to protect metal surfaces from degradation caused by corrosion. Water-based paints are a type of anti-corrosion paint that contains water as its main solvent. These paints are low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and are environmentally friendly. Solvent-based paints, on the other hand, use organic solvents as their primary solvent. These paints provide excellent durability and adhesion, making them suitable for harsh environments. However, they release high levels of VOCs, making them less environmentally friendly compared to water-based paints.</p></p>
