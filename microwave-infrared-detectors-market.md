<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microwave Infrared Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Microwave infrared detectors are sensing devices used to detect motion or presence of objects within a designated area. These detectors can be classified into two types: active and passive. Active detectors emit microwave signals and measure the resulting reflections to detect movement. They are commonly used in automatic door systems or security applications. On the other hand, passive detectors detect subtle changes in infrared energy emitted by objects in their vicinity, without emitting any signals themselves. These detectors are often used in motion-based lighting systems or intruder alert systems.</p></p>
