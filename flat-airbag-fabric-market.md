<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Airbag Fabric Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated</li><li>Uncoated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The flat airbag fabric market can be categorized into two types: coated and uncoated. Coated fabric refers to a type of airbag fabric that has a layer of coating or laminating material applied to its surface. This coating enhances the fabric's properties such as strength, durability, and resistance to abrasion or fraying. On the other hand, uncoated fabric refers to airbag fabric without any additional coating, which may offer a more natural and lightweight feel. The choice between coated and uncoated fabric depends on the specific requirements of the airbag application.</p></p>
