<p><strong>The Sodium Soap Based Dry Wire Drawing Lubricants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sodium Hydroxide</li><li>Sodium Stearate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sodium soap based dry wire drawing lubricants are a type of lubricant used in the wire drawing process, where a metal wire is pulled through a die to reduce its diameter. These lubricants are primarily made from two components: sodium hydroxide and sodium stearate. Sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda, is a strong alkali used in the soap-making process. Sodium stearate is a type of soap derived from stearic acid, which is derived from animal or vegetable fats. Together, these components form an effective lubricant for the wire drawing process.</p></p>
