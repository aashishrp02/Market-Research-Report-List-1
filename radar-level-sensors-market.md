<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radar Level Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-Air</li><li>Guided-Wave</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radar Level Sensors are used for accurately measuring the level of liquids or bulk solids in tanks or containers. They come in two main types: Through-Air and Guided-Wave. Through-Air sensors emit radar waves that travel through the air and bounce off the surface of the liquid or solid, providing accurate level measurements. Guided-Wave sensors, on the other hand, transmit radar signals along a probe that is immersed in the liquid, ensuring reliable measurements even in dusty or vapor-filled environments. Both types of sensors play a crucial role in industries such as oil and gas, wastewater management, and food processing.</p></p>
