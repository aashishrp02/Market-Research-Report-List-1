<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pollution Facemask Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Replaceable Particulate Respirators</li><li>Disposable Particulate Respirators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The pollution facemask market consists of two main types: replaceable particulate respirators and disposable particulate respirators. Replaceable particulate respirators are masks with removable filters that can be replaced once they are clogged or worn out. On the other hand, disposable particulate respirators are masks that are designed for single-use and are typically discarded after each use. Both types of masks serve the purpose of protecting individuals from harmful pollutants in the air, but they differ in terms of longevity and cost-effectiveness.</p></p>
