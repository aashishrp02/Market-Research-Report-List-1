<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Normal Superphosphate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Water</li><li>Without Water</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Normal superphosphate is a type of fertilizer that contains phosphorus, sulfur, and calcium. The market types for normal superphosphate can be categorized as "with water" and "without water." "With water" superphosphates are produced by mixing sulfuric acid with phosphate rock and then forming a slurry with water. This type of superphosphate is easier and cheaper to produce. On the other hand, "without water" superphosphates are made by reacting phosphorus rock with phosphoric acid, resulting in a powdered product. This type is more expensive but has a longer shelf life and is easier to handle and transport.</p></p>
