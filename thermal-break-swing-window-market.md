<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Break Swing Window Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Glass</li><li>Single Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal break swing windows are available in two market types: double glass and single glass. Double glass windows have two panes of glass with an air or gas-filled space in between, providing better insulation and energy efficiency. They are commonly used in colder climates to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature. On the other hand, single glass windows have one pane of glass without any insulating space, making them less effective in preventing heat transfer. They are often used in warmer climates where insulation is less of a concern.</p></p>
