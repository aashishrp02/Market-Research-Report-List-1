<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Uncooled Infrared Thermal Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vanadium Oxide (VOx)</li><li>Amorphous Silicon (A-Si)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The uncooled infrared thermal camera market consists of two main types: Vanadium Oxide (VOx) and Amorphous Silicon (A-Si). VOx cameras use a vanadium oxide-based material that changes its electrical resistance when exposed to infrared radiation, allowing for thermal imaging. A-Si cameras, on the other hand, utilize an amorphous silicon material which absorbs infrared radiation and converts it into an electric charge, enabling temperature detection. Both VOx and A-Si technologies play a crucial role in the uncooled infrared thermal camera market, catering to different applications and customer requirements.</p></p>
