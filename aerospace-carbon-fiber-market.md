<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerospace Carbon Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyacrylonitrile-Based Carbon Fiber</li><li>Pitch-Based Carbon Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aerospace carbon fiber market can be categorized into two types: Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon fiber and Pitch-based carbon fiber. PAN-based carbon fiber is derived from the polymer PAN, which is processed and heat-treated to produce a strong and lightweight material with high tensile strength and stiffness. On the other hand, Pitch-based carbon fiber is produced from coal tar pitch, which undergoes a similar process to PAN-based carbon fiber. However, pitch-based carbon fiber exhibits higher thermal conductivity and better resistance to chemicals and oxidation compared to PAN-based carbon fiber.</p></p>
