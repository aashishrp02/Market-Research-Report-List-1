<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tissue Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Allograft</li><li>Xenograft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tissue patch market consists of two main types: Allograft and Xenograft. Allografts involve using tissues from a human donor, such as skin or bone, which are obtained from a tissue bank. These patches are advantageous due to their compatibility and reduced risk of transmitting diseases. Xenografts, on the other hand, use tissues from animals, such as pigs or cows, and are processed to minimize immune responses. This type of patch is utilized when human tissues are not available or suitable, but it carries a higher risk of rejection.</p></p>
