<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electroless Copper for Multi-Layered Boards Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Electroless Copper</li><li>Vertical Electroless Copper</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The market for electroless copper in multi-layered boards can be divided into two types: horizontal electroless copper and vertical electroless copper. Horizontal electroless copper refers to the process where copper is plated onto the entire surface of a substrate, forming a uniform layer. This method is suitable for single-sided PCBs or inner layers of multi-layered boards. On the other hand, vertical electroless copper involves plating copper onto the walls of drilled holes, creating conductive pathways between the different layers of the board. This technique is commonly used in the production of through-hole PCBs or as a base for subsequent copper plating processes.</p></p>
