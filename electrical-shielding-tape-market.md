<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Shielding Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Adhesive Shielding Tapes</li><li>Non-Adhesive Shielding Tapes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrical shielding tape is categorized into two types: adhesive shielding tapes and non-adhesive shielding tapes. Adhesive shielding tapes are coated with an adhesive substance on one side, making them easier to apply and ensuring a secure bond to surfaces. These tapes are commonly used for shielding electrical components and creating a conductive pathway. On the other hand, non-adhesive shielding tapes do not have adhesive coatings and are often utilized in applications where adhesive residue or contamination is not preferred. Both types serve the purpose of providing electromagnetic shielding and protecting against electrical interference.</p></p>
